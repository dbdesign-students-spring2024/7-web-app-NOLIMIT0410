# Flask-MongoDB Web App

## Title for the APP
It's called Fitness recorder

## Discription of the app
Basically it can be treated as a tracker, a diary system that allows you to record your conditions, your perfromances of the day into the recorder, so you can keep track of them constantly. I personally lift weights, so I know how important it is to keep track your performance. With a clear, digitalized recording system, athletes could make better future plans and gain maximum growth.

## A link to the deployed copy
Very unfortunately, I don't have it. Honestly, I spent almost the same time trying to publish it as I spent building the app. I followed all the instructions word by word, but server error is still not fixed. I ran into many problems like python3 incompatibility, handshake error, can't find dependency, and so many other stuff that makes me spent and frustrated. I tried to debug some of them, but my abilities were not capable of acomplising that.

It's 10:40pm as I am writing this, and I have spent 6 hours in front of the monitor, trying to deploy it. I've tried my best, and I'm going to leave it like this. Everythig runs so perfectly in my local end, but I just can't publish it. It's like having answers in handGGs but not able to hand it in. There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry about it.

## Those who I worked with
I'm terrible at socializing, so I finished this exercise on my own. No one helped me, so I am not able to give any NYU IDs or names. 

Thanks for reading my complaints. I'm very satisfied with my APP. I tried. GG guys.
